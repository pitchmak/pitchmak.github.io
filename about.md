### Hi, I'm Pitchmak.

This is the personal site of Pitchmak Sareerat - iOS Developer from Thailand. I build mobile applications using native and web technologies.

### Background

In March of 2011, I graduated with honors with a BS degree in Computer Engineering from Chiang Mai University. Through now, I've been building mobile applications. In mid 2012 I started creating enterprise-class iOS applications and distributed in-house apps within company using [Apple Developer Enterprise Program][1]. I focused on mobile application development and also interested in web technologies such as [React Native][2] to help development easier.

If you want to get in touch, you can email me at [pitchmak@gmail.com](mailto:pitchmak@gmail.com) and I'll do my best to get back to you.
